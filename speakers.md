### Rachel Greenstadt: On the Value of Anonymity in Internet Discourse

It’s no secret that the Internet has had—generously speaking—a mixed record on improving societal discourse. Does anonymity on the Internet facilitate harassment, vandalism, and trolling or is it a vital protection for marginalized voices? How could we even know?

In this talk, I’ll discuss my lab’s research on why (and how) Wikipedia, the encyclopedia that “anyone can edit” refuses contributions from anonymous users and our research on the privacy concerns of Wikipedians. Although Wikipedia has taken steps to block contributions from Tor users since as early as 2005, we demonstrate that these blocks have been imperfect and that tens of thousands of attempts to edit on Wikipedia through Tor have been successful. We draw upon several data sources to measure and describe the history of Tor editing on Wikipedia over time and to compare contributions of Tor users to other groups of Wikipedia users. Our analysis suggests that the Tor users who manage to slip through Wikipedia's ban contribute content that is similar in quality to other sets of users.

One of our key findings in this work (and other work on mental health on social media, and the threat models around intimate partner surveillance) is that consensus perspectives, conventional wisdom, and threat models can fail when they fail to consider diverse perspectives and lived experiences.

### Grant Ho: Detecting and Characterizing Lateral Phishing at Scale

This talk will examine the problem of lateral phishing attacks, based on a large-scale analysis of 113 million employee-sent emails from 92 enterprise organizations. In a lateral phishing attack, adversaries leverage a compromised enterprise account to send phishing emails to other users, benefitting from both the implicit trust and the information in the hijacked user’s account. We develop a classifier that finds hundreds of real-world lateral phishing emails, while generating under four false positives per every one-million employee-sent emails. Drawing on the attacks we detect, as well as a corpus of user-reported incidents, we quantify the scale of lateral phishing, identify several thematic content and recipient targeting strategies that attackers follow, illuminate two types of sophisticated behaviors that attackers exhibit, and estimate the success rate of these attacks. Collectively, these results expand our mental models of the ‘enterprise attacker’ and shed light on the current state of enterprise phishing attacks.

> Grant Ho is a UCSD CSE Postdoctoral Fellow, where he works with Geoff Voelker and Stefan Savage. His research studies how we can effectively leverage large-scale data to improve computer security. He is the recipient of a Facebook PhD Fellowship, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, three distinguished paper awards, and the 2017 Internet Defense Prize. Previously he received his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, where he worked with David Wagner and Vern Paxson.

### Abigail Marsh: Panel: Socially Responsible Security and Privacy research

> Abigail Marsh is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Macalester College, where their research focuses on the usable privacy concerns of situations where multiple stakeholders have access to one account or device, including familial and romantic relationships, older adults and their caretakers, and many other groups. They additionally research privacy and security concerns introduced by assistive technology.

### Tal Rabin: You Only Speak Once -- Secure MPC with Stateless Ephemeral Roles

The inherent difficulty of maintaining stateful environments over long periods of time gave rise to the paradigm of serverless computing, where mostly-stateless components are deployed on demand to handle computation tasks, and are teared down once their task is complete. Serverless architecture could offer the added benefit of improved resistance to targeted denial-of-service attacks. Realizing such protection, requires that the protocol only uses stateless parties. Perhaps the most famous example of this style of protocols is the Nakamoto consensus protocol used in Bitcoin. We refer to this stateless property as the You-Only-Speak-Once (YOSO) property, and initiate the formal study of it within a new YOSO model. Our model is centered around the notion of roles, which are stateless parties that can only send a single  message. Furthermore, we describe several techniques for achieving YOSO MPC; both computational and information theoretic.

### Vanessa Teague: Panel: Socially Responsible Security and Privacy Research

> Vanessa Teague is the CEO of Thinking Cybersecurity and Associate Prof
(Adj.) in the Research School of Computer Science at the Australian
National University. Her research focuses primarily on cryptographic
methods for achieving security and privacy, particularly for issues of
public interest such as election integrity and the protection of
government data. She was part of the team (with Chris Culnane and Ben
Rubinstein) who discovered the easy re-identification of doctors and
patients in the Medicare/PBS open dataset released by the Australian
Department of Health. She has co-designed numerous protocols for
improved election integrity in e-voting systems, and co-discovered
serious weaknesses in the cryptography of deployed e-voting systems in
New South Wales, Western Australia and Switzerland. She lives and works
on Wurundjeri land in Southeastern Australia (near Melbourne).
