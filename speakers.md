### Rachel Greenstadt: On the Value of Anonymity in Internet Discourse

It’s no secret that the Internet has had—generously speaking—a mixed record on improving societal discourse. Does anonymity on the Internet facilitate harassment, vandalism, and trolling or is it a vital protection for marginalized voices? How could we even know?

In this talk, I’ll discuss my lab’s research on why (and how) Wikipedia, the encyclopedia that “anyone can edit” refuses contributions from anonymous users and our research on the privacy concerns of Wikipedians. Although Wikipedia has taken steps to block contributions from Tor users since as early as 2005, we demonstrate that these blocks have been imperfect and that tens of thousands of attempts to edit on Wikipedia through Tor have been successful. We draw upon several data sources to measure and describe the history of Tor editing on Wikipedia over time and to compare contributions of Tor users to other groups of Wikipedia users. Our analysis suggests that the Tor users who manage to slip through Wikipedia's ban contribute content that is similar in quality to other sets of users.

One of our key findings in this work (and other work on mental health on social media, and the threat models around intimate partner surveillance) is that consensus perspectives, conventional wisdom, and threat models can fail when they fail to consider diverse perspectives and lived experiences.

### Grant Ho: Detecting and Characterizing Lateral Phishing at Scale

This talk will examine the problem of lateral phishing attacks, based on a large-scale analysis of 113 million employee-sent emails from 92 enterprise organizations. In a lateral phishing attack, adversaries leverage a compromised enterprise account to send phishing emails to other users, benefitting from both the implicit trust and the information in the hijacked user’s account. We develop a classifier that finds hundreds of real-world lateral phishing emails, while generating under four false positives per every one-million employee-sent emails. Drawing on the attacks we detect, as well as a corpus of user-reported incidents, we quantify the scale of lateral phishing, identify several thematic content and recipient targeting strategies that attackers follow, illuminate two types of sophisticated behaviors that attackers exhibit, and estimate the success rate of these attacks. Collectively, these results expand our mental models of the ‘enterprise attacker’ and shed light on the current state of enterprise phishing attacks.

> Grant Ho is a UCSD CSE Postdoctoral Fellow, where he works with Geoff Voelker and Stefan Savage. His research studies how we can effectively leverage large-scale data to improve computer security.

### Kevin Kornegay: IoT Security Research at the CAP Center

The mission of the Cybersecurity Assurance and Policy (CAP) Center at Morgan State University is to provide the defense and intelligence community with the knowledge, methodology, solutions, and highly skilled cybersecurity professionals to mitigate penetration and manipulation of our nation’s cyber-physical infrastructure. The Internet of Things (IoT) permeates all areas of life and work, with unprecedented economic effects. The IoT is a network of dedicated physical objects (things) whose embedded system technology senses or interacts with its internal state or external environment. Embedded systems perform dedicated functions within larger mechanical or electrical systems. Critical infrastructures in transportation, smart grid, manufacturing, and health care, etc. are highly dependent on embedded systems for distributed control, tracking, and data collection. While it is paramount to protect these systems from hacking, intrusion, and physical tampering, current solutions rely on a patchwork of legacy systems, and this is unsustainable as a long-term solution. Transformative solutions are required to protect these systems. In this talk, we will present our current research that addresses security vulnerabilities in IoT ecosystems to provide secure, resilient, and robust operation.

> Kevin T. Kornegay received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, NY, in 1985 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1990 and 1992, respectively.

### Tal Rabin: You Only Speak Once -- Secure MPC with Stateless Ephemeral Roles

The inherent difficulty of maintaining stateful environments over long periods of time gave rise to the paradigm of serverless computing, where mostly-stateless components are deployed on demand to handle computation tasks, and are teared down once their task is complete. Serverless architecture could offer the added benefit of improved resistance to targeted denial-of-service attacks. Realizing such protection, requires that the protocol only uses stateless parties. Perhaps the most famous example of this style of protocols is the Nakamoto consensus protocol used in Bitcoin. We refer to this stateless property as the You-Only-Speak-Once (YOSO) property, and initiate the formal study of it within a new YOSO model. Our model is centered around the notion of roles, which are stateless parties that can only send a single  message. Furthermore, we describe several techniques for achieving YOSO MPC; both computational and information theoretic.

### Ketchiozo Thierry Wandji: Software Assurance and Software Certification for High Assurance Mission Critical Systems.
Description: According to DoD, Software Assurance relates to the level of confidence that software functions as intended and is free of vulnerabilities, either intentionally or unintentionally designed or inserted as part of the software. Nowadays, many DoD-developed weapon systems are software-intensive systems; which means that software controls a significant portion of weapon systems functionalities or capabilities. This software is often an integration of components including third-party custom software, open-source software, and/or general-purpose off-the-shelf software, limiting our understanding of risk. DoD needs a robust software security certification process that provides the evidence necessary to manage such risk in high assurance environments. Software development processes for high assurance environments can benefit from an integrated certification framework that helps assess, measure, and manage security risk originating from software artifacts.

> With over 15 years of academic research and teaching, private industry, and government experience, Dr. Ketchiozo Thierry Wandji is an expert in cybersecurity risk management and software security. Dr. Wandji used to be the Software Security Technical Lead in the Systems Security Division of the USNavy’s Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAVAIR) and the Cybersecurity Technical Expert in the Cyber Warfare Detachment. Dr. Wandji’s duties at NAVAIR included assessing software security throughout the software development lifecycle; planning, developing, and coordinating high-impact research projects on cyber defensive technologies; overseeing the development of innovative cybertechnologies; providing policy guidance and standards as well as workforce development for software security; and integrating these standards into the acquisition process to ensure that systems are both reliable and highly-resilient to cyberattacks. Currently, Dr. Wandji advances education in the field as an Associate Director for the Cybersecurity Assurance and Policy (CAP) Center and an Associate Professor at Morgan State University, where he teaches cybersecurity, oversees cybersecurity research studies, and designs cybersecurity curriculum. He has played an integral role in the design and implementation of cybersecurity virtual labs (cyber range)  for  students  to have a hands-on cybersecurity experience. Likewise, Dr. Wandji helped put together a comprehensive program of cybersecurity   workforce development for the Department of the Navy which helped many engineers to become cybersecurity experts.

> Hailing originally from Cameroun, Dr. Wandji pursued his BS in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic School of Engineering at Montreal, Canada in 2003 and went on to obtain an MS in Electrical Engineering from Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD in 2007. During his graduate studies, Dr. Wandji worked as a research assistant on a NASA-funded project aimed at designing and implementing software components to analyze the operations of weather radar and GPS. Following his graduation, Dr. Wandji supported Rockwell Collins as a Radar System Engineer before joining NAVAIR as an Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Engineer and then as EMI Lead Systems Engineer. During this period, he noted that most systems were software intensive and that most electromagnetic issues were fixed by software updates, thus prompting him to delve into research on Software Reliability Modeling. Dr. Wandji earned his PhD in Systems Engineering at George Washington University  (2015)  with a dissertation on the  Assessment of Software reliability using Classical and Bayesian methodologies to estimate Software Reliability Growth Model Parameters.Upon graduation he was promoted to Software Reliability Technical Lead and responsible for assessing the software maturity/reliability for all the software intensive systems developed by NAVAIR.

> Throughout his research studies in Software Reliability, Dr Wandji realized that software security was not being addressed throughout system security analysis nor cybersecurity risk assessment, which prompted him to further his technical knowledge through an MS in Cybersecurity Technology in 2017 from the University of Maryland, University College. The same year, he also earned a graduate certificate in Cybersecurity with a focus on Embedded Systems from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Most recently, Dr.   Wandji has   completed a three-stage NAVAIR cybersecurity workforce development program, which concluded with a highly selective and competitive technical rotation at the NavalResearch Lab. This technical rotation has provided him with hands-on experience in software security and cybersecurity.

> In addition to teaching in this area of expertise, Dr. Wandji has created a software security community of practice to leverage the best practices and share work experience and challenges. Dr. Wandji has led and coordinated a research and development team composed of researchers from NASA JPL, MITRE, and academia to work on high-impact research projects, which has resulted in a number of published articles and journal papers on software reliability and software security, tutorials at the US Department of Defense, and presentations at private industry conferences. He is a member of the NSBE, IEEE, INCOSE,and EMC society.
